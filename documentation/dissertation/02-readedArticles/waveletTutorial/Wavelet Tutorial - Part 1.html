        Fundamental Concepts and an Overview of the Wavelet Theory

      <br><br>

      Welcome to this introductory tutorial on wavelet transforms. The 
wavelet transform is a relatively new concept (about 10 years old), but 
yet there are quite a few articles and books written on them. However, 
most of these books and articles are written by math people, for the 
other math people; still most of the math people don't know what the 
other math people are talking about (a math professor of mine made this 
confession). In other words, majority of the literature available on 
wavelet transforms are of little help, if any, to those who are new to 
this subject (this is my personal opinion).

      <br><br>

      When I first started working on wavelet transforms I have 
struggled for many hours and days to figure out what was going on in 
this mysterious world of wavelet transforms, due to the lack of 
introductory level text(s) in this subject. Therefore, I have decided to
 write this tutorial for the ones who are new to the this topic. I 
consider myself quite new to the subject too, and I have to confess that
 I have not figured out all the theoretical details yet. However, as far
 as the engineering applications are concerned, I think all the 
theoretical details are not necessarily necessary (!).

      <br><br>

      In this tutorial I will try to give basic principles underlying 
the wavelet theory. The proofs of the theorems and related equations 
will not be given in this tutorial due to the simple assumption that the
 intended readers of this tutorial do not need them at this time. 
However, interested readers will be directed to related references for 
further and in-depth information.

      <br><br>

      In this document I am assuming that you have no background 
knowledge, whatsoever. If you do have this background, please disregard 
the following information, since it may be trivial.

      <br><br>

      Should you find any inconsistent, or incorrect information in the 
following tutorial, please feel free to contact me. I will appreciate 
any comments on this page.

      <strong>TRANS... WHAT?</strong>

      <br><br>

      First of all, why do we need a transform, or what is a transform anyway?

      <br><br>

      Mathematical transformations are applied to signals to obtain a 
further information from that signal that is not readily available in 
the <strong>raw</strong> signal. In the following tutorial I will assume
 a time-domain signal as a raw signal, and a signal that has been 
"transformed" by any of the available mathematical transformations as a <strong>processed</strong> signal.

      <br><br>

      There are number of transformations that can be applied, among 
which the Fourier transforms are probably by far the most popular.

      <br><br>

      Most of the signals in practice, are <strong>TIME-DOMAIN</strong> 
signals in their raw format. That is, whatever that signal is measuring,
 is a function of time. In other words, when we plot the signal one of 
the axes is time (independent variable), and the other (dependent 
variable) is usually the amplitude. When we plot time-domain signals, we
 obtain a <strong>time-amplitude representation</strong> of the signal. 
This representation is not always the best representation of the signal 
for most signal processing related applications. In many cases, the most
 distinguished information is hidden in the frequency content of the 
signal. The <strong>frequency SPECTRUM</strong> of a signal is basically
 the frequency components (spectral components) of that signal. The 
frequency spectrum of a signal shows what frequencies exist in the 
signal.

      <br><br>

      Intuitively, we all know that the frequency is something to do 
with the change in rate of something. If something ( a mathematical or 
physical variable, would be the technically correct term) changes 
rapidly, we say that it is of high frequency, where as if this variable 
does not change rapidly, i.e., it changes smoothly, we say that it is of
 low frequency. If this variable does not change at all, then we say it 
has zero frequency, or no frequency. For example the publication 
frequency of a daily newspaper is higher than that of a monthly magazine
 (it is published more frequently).

      <br><br>

      The frequency is measured in cycles/second, or with a more common 
name, in "Hertz". For example the electric power we use in our daily 
life in the US is 60 Hz (50 Hz elsewhere in the world). This means that 
if you try to plot the electric current, it will be a sine wave passing 
through the same point 50 times in 1 second. Now, look at the following 
figures. The first one is a sine wave at 3 Hz, the second one at 10 Hz, 
and the third one at 50 Hz. Compare them.

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_3.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">

      <br><br>

      So how do we measure frequency, or how do we find the frequency content of a signal? The answer is <strong>FOURIER TRANSFORM (FT)</strong>.
 If the FT of a signal in time domain is taken, the frequency-amplitude 
representation of that signal is obtained. In other words, we now have a
 plot with one axis being the frequency and the other being the 
amplitude. This plot tells us how much of each frequency exists in our 
signal.

      <br><br>

      The frequency axis starts from zero, and goes up to infinity. For 
every frequency, we have an amplitude value. For example, if we take the
 FT of the electric current that we use in our houses, we will have one 
spike at 50 Hz, and nothing elsewhere, since that signal has only 50 Hz 
frequency component. No other signal, however, has a FT which is this 
simple. For most practical purposes, signals contain more than one 
frequency component. The following shows the FT of the 50 Hz signal:

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_4.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.4 The FT of the 50 Hz signal given in Figure 1.3
      </div>

      <br><br>

      One word of caution is in order at this point. Note that two plots
 are given in Figure 1.4. The bottom one plots only the first half of 
the top one. Due to reasons that are not crucial to know at this time, 
the frequency spectrum of a real valued signal is always symmetric. The 
top plot illustrates this point. However, since the symmetric part is 
exactly a mirror image of the first part, it provides no additional 
information, and therefore, this symmetric second part is usually not 
shown. In most of the following figures corresponding to FT, I will only
 show the first half of this symmetric spectrum.

      <hr>
      <h1 class="section-title">
        Why do we need the frequency information?
      </h1>

      <br>

      Often times, the information that cannot be readily seen in the time-domain can be seen in the frequency domain.

      <br><br>

      Let's give an example from biological signals. Suppose we are 
looking at an ECG signal (ElectroCardioGraphy, graphical recording of 
heart's electrical activity). The typical shape of a healthy ECG signal 
is well known to cardiologists. Any significant deviation from that 
shape is usually considered to be a symptom of a pathological condition.

      <br><br>

      This pathological condition, however, may not always be quite 
obvious in the original time-domain signal. Cardiologists usually use 
the time-domain ECG signals which are recorded on strip-charts to 
analyze ECG signals. Recently, the new computerized ECG 
recorders/analyzers also utilize the frequency information to decide 
whether a pathological condition exists. A pathological condition can 
sometimes be diagnosed more easily when the frequency content of the 
signal is analyzed.

      <br><br>

      This, of course, is only one simple example why frequency content 
might be useful. Today Fourier transforms are used in many different 
areas including all branches of engineering.

      <br><br>

      Although FT is probably the most popular transform being used 
(especially in electrical engineering), it is not the only one. There 
are many other transforms that are used quite often by engineers and 
mathematicians. Hilbert transform, short-time Fourier transform (more 
about this later), Wigner distributions, the Radon Transform, and of 
course our <strong>featured transformation</strong>, the wavelet 
transform, constitute only a small portion of a huge list of transforms 
that are available at engineer's and mathematician's disposal. Every 
transformation technique has its own area of application, with 
advantages and disadvantages, and the wavelet transform (WT) is no 
exception.

      <br><br>

      For a better understanding of the need for the WT let's look at 
the FT more closely. FT (as well as WT) is a reversible transform, that 
is, it allows to go back and forward between the raw and processed 
(transformed) signals. However, only either of them is available at any 
given time. That is, no frequency information is available in the 
time-domain signal, and no time information is available in the Fourier 
transformed signal. The natural question that comes to mind is that is 
it necessary to have both the time and the frequency information at the 
same time?

      <br><br>

      As we will see soon, the answer depends on the particular 
application, and the nature of the signal in hand. Recall that the FT 
gives the frequency information of the signal, which means that it tells
 us how much of each frequency exists in the signal, but it does not 
tell us <strong>when in time</strong> these frequency components exist. This information is not required when the signal is so-called <strong>stationary</strong>.

      <br><br>

      Let's take a closer look at this <strong>stationarity</strong> 
concept more closely, since it is of paramount importance in signal 
analysis. Signals whose frequency content do not change in time are 
called <strong>stationary signals</strong>. In other words, the frequency content of stationary signals do not change in time. In this case, one does not need to know <strong>at what times frequency components exist</strong>, since all frequency components exist at all times!!!

      <br><br>

      For example the following signal

      <br><br>

      <div class="text-center">
        <!-- x(t)=cos(2*pi*10*t)+cos(2*pi*25*t)+cos(2*pi*50*t)+cos(2*pi*100*t) -->
        <span class="MathJax_Preview">x(t) = cos(2 \pi \cdot 10 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 25 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 50 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 100 t)</span><script type="math/tex">x(t) = cos(2 \pi \cdot 10 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 25 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 50 t) + cos(2 \pi \cdot 100 t)</script>
      </div>

      <br><br>

      is a stationary signal, because it has frequencies of 10, 25, 50, 
and 100 Hz at any given time instant. This signal is plotted below:

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_5.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.5
      </div>

      <br><br>

      And the following is its FT:

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_6.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.6
      </div>

      <br><br>

      The top plot in Figure 1.6 is the (half of the symmetric) 
frequency spectrum of the signal in Figure 1.5. The bottom plot is the 
zoomed version of the top plot, showing only the range of frequencies 
that are of interest to us. Note the four spectral components 
corresponding to the frequencies 10, 25, 50 and 100 Hz.

      <br><br>

      Contrary to the signal in Figure 1.5, the following signal is not 
stationary. Figure 1.7 plots a signal whose frequency constantly changes
 in time. This signal is known as the "chirp" signal. This is a 
non-stationary signal.

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_7.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.7
      </div>

      <br><br>

      Let's look at another example. Figure 1.8 plots a signal with four
 different frequency components at four different time intervals, hence a
 non-stationary signal. The interval 0 to 300 ms has a 100 Hz sinusoid, 
the interval 300 to 600 ms has a 50 Hz sinusoid, the interval 600 to 800
 ms has a 25 Hz sinusoid, and finally the interval 800 to 1000 ms has a 
10 Hz sinusoid.

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_8.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.8
      </div>

      <br><br>

      And the following is its FT:

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_9.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.9
      </div>

      <br><br>

      Do not worry about the little ripples at this time; they are due 
to sudden changes from one frequency component to another, which have no
 significance in this text. Note that the amplitudes of higher frequency
 components are higher than those of the lower frequency ones. This is 
due to fact that higher frequencies last longer (300 ms each) than the 
lower frequency components (200 ms each). (The exact value of the 
amplitudes are not important).

      <br><br>

      Other than those ripples, everything seems to be right. The FT has
 four peaks, corresponding to four frequencies with reasonable 
amplitudes... Right?

      <br><br>

      <strong>WRONG (!)</strong>

      <br><br>

      Well, not exactly wrong, but not exactly right either... Here is why:

      <br><br>

      For the first signal, plotted in Figure 1.5, consider the following question:

      At what times (or time intervals), do these frequency components occur?

      <br><br>

      Answer:

      <br><br>

      At all times! Remember that in stationary signals, all frequency 
components that exist in the signal, exist throughout the entire 
duration of the signal. There is 10 Hz at all times, there is 50 Hz at 
all times, and there is 100 Hz at all times.

      <br><br>

      Now, consider the same question for the non-stationary signal in Figure 1.7 or in Figure 1.8.

      <br><br>

      For the signal in Figure 1.8, we know that in the first interval 
we have the highest frequency component, and in the last interval we 
have the lowest frequency component. For the signal in Figure 1.7, the 
frequency components change continuously. Therefore, for these signals 
the frequency components <strong>do not</strong> appear at all times!

      <br><br>

      Now, compare the Figures 1.6 and 1.9. The similarity between these
 two spectrum should be apparent. Both of them show four spectral 
components at exactly the same frequencies, i.e., at 10, 25, 50, and 100
 Hz. Other than the ripples, and the difference in amplitude (which can 
always be normalized), the two spectrums are almost identical, although 
the corresponding time-domain signals are not even close to each other. 
Both of the signals involves the same frequency components, but the 
first one has these frequencies at all times, the second one has these 
frequencies at different intervals. So, how come the spectrums of two 
entirely different signals look very much alike? Recall that the FT 
gives the spectral content of the signal, but it gives no information 
regarding <strong>where in time those spectral components appear</strong>. Therefore, FT is not a suitable technique for non-stationary signal, with one exception:

      <br><br>

      FT can be used for non-stationary signals, if we are only 
interested in what spectral components exist in the signal, but not 
interested where these occur. However, if this information is needed, 
i.e., if we want to know, what spectral component occur at what time 
(interval) , then Fourier transform is not the right transform to use.

      <br><br>

      For practical purposes it is difficult to make the separation, 
since there are a lot of practical stationary signals, as well as 
non-stationary ones. Almost all biological signals, for example, are 
non-stationary. Some of the most famous ones are ECG (electrical 
activity of the heart , electrocardiograph), EEG (electrical activity of
 the brain, electroencephalograph), and EMG (electrical activity of the 
muscles, electromyogram).

      <br><br>

      <strong>
        Once again please note that, the FT gives what frequency 
components (spectral components) exist in the signal. Nothing more, 
nothing less.
      </strong>

      <br><br>

      When the <strong>time localization</strong> of the spectral components are needed, a transform giving the TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION of the signal is needed.

        The Ultimate Solution: The Wavelet Transform
      </h1>

      <br><br>

      The Wavelet transform is a transform of this type. It provides the
 time-frequency representation. (There are other transforms which give 
this information too, such as short time Fourier transform, Wigner 
distributions, etc.)

      <br><br>

      Often times a particular spectral component occurring at any 
instant can be of particular interest. In these cases it may be very 
beneficial to know the time intervals these particular spectral 
components occur. For example, in EEGs, the latency of an event-related 
potential is of particular interest (Event-related potential is the 
response of the brain to a specific stimulus like flash-light, the 
latency of this response is the amount of time elapsed between the onset
 of the stimulus and the response).

      <br><br>

      Wavelet transform is capable of providing the time and frequency 
information simultaneously, hence giving a time-frequency representation
 of the signal.

      <br><br>

      How wavelet transform works is completely a different fun story, and should be explained after <strong>short time Fourier Transform (STFT)</strong>.
 The WT was developed as an alternative to the STFT. The STFT will be 
explained in great detail in the second part of this tutorial. It 
suffices at this time to say that the WT was developed to overcome some 
resolution related problems of the STFT, as explained in Part II.

      <br><br>

      To make a real long story short, we pass the time-domain signal 
from various highpass and low pass filters, which filters out either 
high frequency or low frequency portions of the signal. This procedure 
is repeated, every time some portion of the signal corresponding to some
 frequencies being removed from the signal.

      <br><br>

      Here is how this works: Suppose we have a signal which has 
frequencies up to 1000 Hz. In the first stage we split up the signal in 
to two parts by passing the signal from a highpass and a lowpass filter 
(filters should satisfy some certain conditions, so-called <strong>admissibility condition</strong>)
 which results in two different versions of the same signal: portion of 
the signal corresponding to 0-500 Hz (low pass portion), and 500-1000 Hz
 (high pass portion).

      <br><br>

      Then, we take either portion (usually low pass portion) or both, and do the same thing again. This operation is called <strong>decomposition</strong>.

      <br><br>

      Assuming that we have taken the lowpass portion, we now have 3 
sets of data, each corresponding to the same signal at frequencies 0-250
 Hz, 250-500 Hz, 500-1000 Hz.

      <br><br>

      Then we take the lowpass portion again and pass it through low and
 high pass filters; we now have 4 sets of signals corresponding to 0-125
 Hz, 125-250 Hz,250-500 Hz, and 500-1000 Hz. We continue like this until
 we have decomposed the signal to a pre-defined certain level. Then we 
have a bunch of signals, which actually represent the same signal, but 
all corresponding to different frequency bands. We know which signal 
corresponds to which frequency band, and if we put all of them together 
and plot them on a 3-D graph, we will have time in one axis, frequency 
in the second and amplitude in the third axis. This will show us which 
frequencies exist at which time ( there is an issue, called "uncertainty
 principle", which states that, we cannot exactly know <strong>what frequency exists</strong> at <strong>what time instance</strong>, but we can only know <strong>what frequency bands exist</strong> at <strong>what time intervals</strong>, more about this in the subsequent parts of this tutorial).

      <br><br>

      However, I still would like to explain it briefly:

      <br><br>

      The uncertainty principle, originally found and formulated by 
Heisenberg, states that, the momentum and the position of a moving 
particle cannot be known simultaneously. This applies to our subject as 
follows:

      <br><br>

      The frequency and time information of a signal at some certain 
point in the time-frequency plane cannot be known. In other words: We 
cannot know what <strong>spectral component</strong> exists at any given time <strong>instant</strong>. The best we can do is to investigate what <strong>spectral components</strong> exist at any given <strong>interval</strong>
 of time. This is a problem of resolution, and it is the main reason why
 researchers have switched to WT from STFT. STFT gives a fixed 
resolution at all times, whereas WT gives a variable resolution as 
follows:

      <br><br>

      Higher frequencies are better resolved in time, and lower 
frequencies are better resolved in frequency. This means that, a certain
 high frequency component can be located better in time (with less 
relative error) than a low frequency component. On the contrary, a low 
frequency component can be located better in frequency compared to high 
frequency component.

      <br><br>

      Take a look at the following grid:

      <br><br>

      <pre>        f ^
          |*******************************************         continuous
          |*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *         wavelet transform
          |*     *     *     *     *     *     *
          |*           *           *           *
          |*                       *
          --------------------------------------------&gt; time
      </pre>

      <br><br>

      Interpret the above grid as follows: The top row shows that at 
higher frequencies we have more samples corresponding to smaller 
intervals of time. In other words, higher frequencies can be resolved 
better in time. The bottom row however, corresponds to low frequencies, 
and there are less number of points to characterize the signal, 
therefore, low frequencies are not resolved well in time.

      <br><br>

        |----------------------------------------------------------&gt; time
      </pre>

      In discrete time case, the time resolution of the signal works the
 same as above, but now, the frequency information has different 
resolutions at every stage too. Note that, lower frequencies are better 
resolved in frequency, where as higher frequencies are not. Note how the
 spacing between subsequent frequency components increase as frequency 
increases.

      <br><br>

      Below , are some examples of continuous wavelet transform: Let's 
take a sinusoidal signal, which has two different frequency components 
at two different times:

      <br><br>

      Note the low frequency portion first, and then the high frequency.

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_10.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.10
      </div>

      <br><br>

      The continuous wavelet transform of the above signal:

      <br><br>

      <img src="Wavelet%20Tutorial%20-%20Part%201_arquivos/figure1_11.png" class="img-responsive" style="display:block; margin:auto;">
      <div class="text-center">
        Figure 1.11
      </div>

      <br><br>

      Note however, the frequency axis in these plots are labeled as 
scale . The concept of the scale will be made more clear in the 
subsequent sections, but it should be noted at this time that the scale 
is inverse of frequency. That is, high scales correspond to low 
frequencies, and low scales correspond to high frequencies. 
Consequently, the little peak in the plot corresponds to the high 
frequency components in the signal, and the large peak corresponds to 
low frequency components (which appear before the high frequency 
components in time) in the signal.

      <br><br>

      You might be puzzled from the frequency resolution shown in the 
plot, since it shows good frequency resolution at high frequencies. Note
 however that, it is the good  scale resolution  that looks good at high
 frequencies (low scales), and good scale resolution means poor 
frequency resolution and vice versa. More about this in Part II and III.
