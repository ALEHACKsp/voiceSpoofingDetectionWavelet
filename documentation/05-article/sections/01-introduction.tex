\label{introduction}
		\par Automatic voice verification, or voice biometry, has been attracting more and more attention from nationals and internationals organizations because it is an alternative to the current user verification systems, or, an additional security layer to  traditional systems.
		
		\par At times of sanitary emergency on which the implementation costs of iris imaging recognition are prohibitive and the validation using digital fingerprints incurs risks for health by the need of physical contact, the voice recognition appears like a viable authentication alternative.
				
		\par So, with the greater interest and use, consequently, greater also are the fraud trying against this systems. Therefore, it is important to distinguish a real authentication request from a fraudulent one. Considering this context, the \textit{voice spoofing attacks} of \textit{playback speech} type constitute the study subject of this work.
