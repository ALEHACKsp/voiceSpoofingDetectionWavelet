\par Playback speech attack (PSA), i.e., the voice spoofing mechanism in which an impostor gains fraudulent access to a biometric system by replaying the recorded target speaker's voice, have received considerable attention from the scientific community. Permanent efforts to find a definitive solution to that problem, however, have not been described in academic literature. Thus, we propose a wavelet-based approach to decompose both genuine and replayed speech signals into different levels of resolution, producing a time-frequency energy map. Subsequently, Paraconsistent Feature Engineering (PFE) is used to assess and rank those wavelet-based features, revealing the specific temporal and spectral details capable of differentiating replayed from genuine speech, with either an ordinary pattern-matching or Support Vector Machine (SVM) knowledge-based classifier. Tests involving a dataset of 820 spoken digits show a value of accuracy superior to 95\% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) equals to 0.102439, confirming the efficacy of the proposed approach. Thus, this is a promising result, considering the state-of-the-art in the field.
