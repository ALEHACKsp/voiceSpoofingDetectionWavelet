see 1
Qualitative selection similar properties of the signal: Para qual sinal devo olhar? Para os coefiecientes ou para os gráficos da função?

See 2

cross correlation
shannon entropy

See 5 and 6

why???
if wavelets with more coefficients separates best the frequencies why am i having such results?

why:
Because WPT decompose not only the aproximantion part of the signal but also de details.

conclusion
Looks like that the eficiency of the feature vector creation has much more correlation with the scales chosen than with the wavlets
